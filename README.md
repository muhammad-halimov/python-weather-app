Hi there !

I'm considering you are looking for some weather app or project , so you found it !

The project uses EEL & pyowm libraryes for UI and check the weather.

If you don't installed this libraryes before, you can just unarchive the venv folder, it contains virtual environment for python and also libaryes, that i mentioned before.

It's also has a executable (.exe) version, if you want you can use it, but it's works slowly(because of auto-py-to-exe library), but hey it's usable !

Some links and comands:
https://www.python.org/downloads/ - download python

venv\Scripts\activate - open cmd and put this comand, ones you unarchive venv.zip (you should unarchive it where it's stays, don't move it somewhere)
python converter.py - to start the project (put it after putting venv\Scripts\activate), once you done you tasks, put deactivate on cmd to deactivate venv
